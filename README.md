Welcome to my repository dedicated to the projects I've completed during the Piscine at 42 S√£o Paulo on August 2023!üññ

## What is 42?
42 is a revolutionary engineering and programming school that offers rigorous training, preparing the next generation of digital leaders and entrepreneurs. What makes 42 unique? There are no teachers, no traditional classes, and students learn from their peers. The school's name is a nod to the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, where 42 is the "answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything."

## The Piscine: Dive Deep into Coding üèä
The Piscine (which means "swimming pool" in French) is a month-long intensive coding bootcamp and is the entrance exam to the 42 program. During this period, students immerse themselves in coding for long hours, developing a strong foundation and proving their dedication and passion for the world of software development.

## Projects
Here, you'll find the projects I've undertaken during this challenging month. These projects range from simple C programs to more complex software, each designed to test, challenge, and expand my programming skills and understanding. The projects were developed around two central themes, as described below:  
- **Shell Projects:** projects centered on manipulating files and directories through the Shell command prompt;
- **C Projects:** projects that aim to introduce concepts and functions of C libraries, ranging from low to high complexity.  

| Project | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Shell00](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/Shell00) | Creating and manipulating files/directories; changing access permissions with chmod command; creating and accessing the SSH key; file listing and ordering methods; displaying log records with git log; learning about git ignore; comparing files with diff and patch commands; use of the find command. |
| [Shell01](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/Shell01) | User data access (id and groups); use of the find command; count of files in the directory; access MAC addresses with ifconfig command; special character handling. |
| [C00](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C00) | Introduction to C programming with string manipulation; use of the write function from the <unistd.h> library. |
| [C01](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C01) | Introduction to manipulating pointers in functions. |
| [C02](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C02) | Reproduction of the operation of the strcpy, strcnpy and strlcpy functions, together with several string validation and manipulation functions. |
| [C03](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C03) | Reproduction of the operation of the strcmp, strncmp, strcat, strncat, strstr and strlcat functions. |
| [C04](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C04) | Operation of the strlen function and type conversion, int to string and vice versa. |
| [C05](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C05) | Introduction to recursive and iterative methods with the creation of functions that perform mathematical calculations (factorial, square root, potentiation, Fibonacci sequence, and prime numbers). |
| [C06](https://github.com/drisanches/42piscine_sp/tree/main/C06) | Introduction to arguments on the command line using argc and **argv. |

## Skills Acquired
- **C Programming:** Deep understanding of C from basic programming to memory management and advanced algorithms;
- **Problem Solving:** Developed a knack for breaking down complex problems and devising effective solutions;
- **Teamwork:** Collaborated with peers, learning the significance of teamwork in software development;
- **Self-learning:** Without traditional instructors, the ability to teach oneself is the heart of 42's pedagogy.

## Reflection
The Piscine was an intense journey, filled with highs and lows. It was not just about learning to code, but also about resilience, collaboration, and pushing beyond perceived limits. I am proud of the progress I made and the projects showcased in this repository are a testament to the hard work, dedication, and passion I brought to 42 S√£o Paulo.
